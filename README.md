Have you ever wished you could turn a simple idea into a full-fledged story with just a click? Welcome to the AI Story Generator — your personal creative writing assistant powered by Generative AI! This innovative project transforms user prompts into imaginative short stories within seconds, blending the magic of storytelling with the power of artificial intelligence.

Built with the versatile distilgpt2 model from HuggingFace and a sleek, interactive Streamlit interface, this application allows users to input a short prompt — such as “A boy finds a magic stone” or “A cat discovers a hidden portal” — and receive a detailed, creative narrative in return. Whether you're a student, writer, or just someone who loves stories, this tool brings your ideas to life in a fun and accessible way.

The interface is designed with simplicity and creativity in mind. Users can choose their desired story length (in words) and creativity level (temperature) using intuitive sliders. The story is then generated in real-time and displayed in a clean, scrollable text box, fully formatted and easy to read — whether you’re on light mode or dark mode.

Under the hood, the model is guided by a natural language prompt that instructs it to generate detailed and coherent stories. The output undergoes post-processing to clean up formatting, remove artifacts, and ensure it flows like a real story — not just AI text. And since distilgpt2 is lightweight, the app runs smoothly on regular systems without needing heavy GPU setups.

But we’re not stopping here! Planned future upgrades include genre-based story generation, text-to-speech narration, multilingual support, and even AI-generated illustrations — turning this project into a complete creative platform for both learning and entertainment.

In short, the AI Story Generator is where technology meets imagination. It’s fast, fun, and endlessly inspiring. Try a prompt — and let the AI surprise you with a story you didn’t know you needed.
